1. List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators
Arithmetic Operators - 
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

Assignment Operators - =, +=, *=, /=, **=

Comparison Operators -
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator

Logical Operators
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not

Bitwise Operators
&	AND	
|	OR	
~	NOT	
^	XOR	
<<	left shift
>>	right shift
>>>	unsigned right shift

For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.
Arithmetic Operators
x + y; addition
x * y; multiplication

Assignment Operators
let score = 20 assignment; 
i += 2 assignment;

Comparison Operators
if score == '20' equal value
if goal != 2 not equal

Logical Operators
if (physics && chemistry){
    console.log("logical AND");
} else (physics || chemistry){
    console.log("logical OR")
}

Bitwise Operators
5 | 1
~5

4. What is the result when the following program is executed?

for (let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7){
    console.log(i)
}

ANSWER = 1, 8, 15
